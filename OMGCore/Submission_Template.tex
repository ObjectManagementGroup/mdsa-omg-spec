\section*{OMG}
Founded in 1989, the Object Management Group, Inc. (OMG) is an open membership, not-for-profit computer industry standards consortium that produces and maintains computer industry specifications for interoperable, portable, and reusable enterprise applications in distributed, heterogeneous environments. Membership includes Information Technology vendors, end users, government agencies, and academia. OMG member companies write, adopt, and maintain its specifications following a mature, open process. OMG's specifications implement the Model Driven Architecture\textregistered\ (MDA\textregistered ), maximizing ROI through a full-lifecycle approach to enterprise integration that covers multiple operating systems, programming languages, middleware and networking infrastructures, and software development environments. OMG's specifications include: UML\textregistered (Unified Modeling Language\texttrademark ); CORBA\textregistered\ (Common Object Request Broker Architecture); CWM\texttrademark\ (Common Warehouse Metamodel); and industry-specific standards for dozens of vertical markets. More information on the OMG is available at \url{https://www.omg.org/}.

\section*{OMG Specifications}

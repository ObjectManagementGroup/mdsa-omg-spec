This file is (mostly) just a placeholder to ensure the folder structure is carried through by git on a first clone.  Feel free to delete this file after cloning this template.

But, while we're here...

GeneratedContent/ is a folder to hold .tex files generated from models.  Manually editing files in there is a bad idea.  The subfolder Images/ is for, obviously, images generated from the models, preferably .svg format.
